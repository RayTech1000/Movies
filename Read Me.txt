Box-Office Budget Prediction, Oscars Classification with Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the box-office performance of the mainstream movies from large production studios. This project uses several regression models and calculates the error of each one. 

This project will demonstrate the connection between numerical and categorical variables with the box-office ticket sales. Also, a second data set was used to predict Oscar nominated films. Classification models with accuracy results were used in order to demonstrate this.
